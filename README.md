**[Master branch](https://github.com/Victor4869/open-alcnet)**

Fix reported issues in the orginal scripts.

**[Dev branch](hhttps://github.com/Victor4869/open-alcnet/tree/dev)**

This branch contains additional features and improvements:
1. The [SIRST](https://github.com/YimianDai/sirst) and [IRSTD-1k](https://github.com/RuiZhang97/ISNet) datasets added to the folder.
2. Added argument to pass the path of the ALCNet folder in Colab.
3. Added argument to pass the root path of the dataset if you are using a dataset outside the ALCNet folder.
4. Improve logging messages
5. Improve File management:

>* Relocate the training log file and parameter file to \params folder. 
>* Relocate the log file and prediction result to \results foler, results from each parameter file will have their own subfoler.

6. Addtional features in the visualize_local_contrast_networks.py scrpit:

>* Record the inference time.
>* Draw the ground truth boudning box in the prediction images for easier comparsion, this feature requires the labelling (.xml) file in the dataset.

If you are unfamiliar with how to setup an environment for MXNet or how to run the scripts, you can check out the tutorial in the [Wiki](https://github.com/Victor4869/open-alcnet/wiki).
